# bibtex-repo

My personal bibtex bibliography. I started this bibtex file and its repository in December 2016, after starting up my workflow from scratch. 

Why from scratch? Well, I acquired a new laptop and felt reluctant simply to migrate my old workflow because of incompatibilities and several different versions of software apparently living alongside one another.

Gradually I will merge in my older and much more extensive bibliography file (3000+ entries).
